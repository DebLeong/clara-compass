## 🌍 Overview

Most people interact with listed companies daily — through their phones, subscriptions, or local services — yet few connect these experiences to investing. Clara Compass makes that connection intuitive.

The app surfaces your *familiar public companies* through a 3-question onboarding flow and uses AI to help you understand their fundamentals over time.

## 🚀 Features

- **3-tap onboarding** — no login or email needed.
- **Instant recognition** — shows your 6 most familiar public companies.
- **AI-ready backend** — designed to later plug into LLM-powered financial analysis.
- **Privacy-first** — all data stays local unless you opt in to deeper analysis.

- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
